
Frogeye leaf spot is a fungal disease that affects soybean plants (Glycine max). The causal agent of frogeye leaf spot is the fungus Cercospora sojina. This disease can result in significant yield losses if not properly managed.

Symptoms: 
1. Circular to irregularly shaped lesions with a gray to tan center and a dark reddish-brown border. 
2. Mature lesions often have a distinctive appearance resembling a frog's eye, with a dark center and lighter outer ring. 
3. Yellowing (chlorosis) may occur around the lesions, and infected leaves may eventually drop prematurely. 
4.  In severe cases, pods and seeds can also become infected.

Solutions: 
1. Planting soybean varieties with genetic resistance to frogeye leaf spot is one of the most effective strategies. 
2. Fungicides may be used as a preventive or curative measure, especially when environmental conditions are conducive to disease development. 
3. Rotate soybeans with non-host crops to break the disease cycle. 
4. Early detection allows for timely intervention. 
5. Implement cultural practices that promote good air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants. 
6. Consider seed treatments with fungicides to protect seedlings from early-season infections. 

Farmers and agricultural professionals should work together to develop an integrated disease management plan that incorporates multiple strategies. 
This can help minimize the impact of frogeye leaf spot on soybean crops and maintain overall crop health and yield.
